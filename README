Launchpad95 : Improved Novation Launchpad remote scripts with Instrument Mode, Scales, Step Sequencer and Device Controller.

These scripts are modified version of Ableton Live 9.0 scripts for Novation Launchpad and provide the same functionality but add support for editing the midi clips using a step sequencer and Device Controller. It also replaces User Mode one with an Instrument Mode mimicking Ableton Push Instrument Mode behaviour.

It does not require any external tool like Max for Live (M4L) in order to work. This script is just a plain Live Control Surface Python Script.
