Launchpad95 : Improved Novation Launchpad remote scripts with Instrument Mode, Scales, Step Sequencer and Device Controller.

These scripts are modified version of Ableton Live 9.0 scripts for Novation Launchpad and provide the same functionality but add support for editing the midi clips using a step sequencer and Device Controller. It also replaces User Mode one with an Instrument Mode mimicking Ableton Push Instrument Mode behaviour.

It does not require any external tool like Max for Live (M4L) in order to work. This script is just a plain Live Control Surface Python Script.

Launchpad2000 fork notes:

- This repository is a fork of hdavid/Launchpad95 with additive OSD and M4L integration.
- To install as Launchpad2000 in Ableton Live:
  1. Clone or download this repository.
  2. Rename the folder to `Launchpad2000`.
  3. Copy it into Ableton's `MIDI Remote Scripts` directory.
  4. Restart Live and select `Launchpad2000` in Preferences -> Link/Tempo/MIDI.

Git remotes for this fork:

- `origin`: https://github.com/LarsonRogers/Launchpad2000.git

## Manual Integration Guide (Max/Ableton Tasks)

The remaining project work is mostly runtime integration and validation that cannot be fully automated from source edits alone. Use this section as the step-by-step checklist.

## 1) Build `Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd` in Max

Goal: create `M4L_Devices/Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd` and wire `osd_bridge.js` to `launchpad_grid.html`.

1. Create a new Max for Live MIDI Effect device.
2. Save as: `M4L_Devices/Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd`.
3. Add objects:
   - `live.thisdevice`
   - `js osd_bridge.js`
   - `jweb @url launchpad_grid.html`
   - `print osd_bridge`
4. Wire:
   - `live.thisdevice` bang output -> `js osd_bridge.js` input
   - `js osd_bridge.js` outlet 0 -> `jweb` input
   - `js osd_bridge.js` outlet 1 -> `jweb` input
   - `js osd_bridge.js` outlet 2 -> `print osd_bridge`
5. Ensure device file paths resolve:
   - `M4L_Devices/js/osd_bridge.js`
   - `osd_maps/ui_templates/launchpad_grid.html`
   - `osd_maps/palettes/mk2_palette.json`
   - `osd_maps/generated_templates/manifest.json`
6. Reload the device and verify the Max Console receives bridge status output (not error spam).

## 2) Verify Ableton Script Discovery as `Launchpad2000`

Goal: confirm the fork is discovered under the renamed folder.

1. Ensure repo folder name is exactly `Launchpad2000`.
2. Place folder in Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory.
3. Restart Ableton Live.
4. Open Preferences -> Link/Tempo/MIDI.
5. In Control Surface dropdown, select `Launchpad2000`.
6. Confirm Launchpad initializes and core LP95 functionality still works.

## 3) Validate Runtime Behavior in Live

Run these tests in order.

### A. Template Rendering Coverage (17 templates)

1. Trigger every supported LP95 mode.
2. Confirm grid/title update for each mode change.
3. Confirm no missing labels, no tooltip leakage, and no malformed cells.

Pass criteria:
- All templates render without JS errors.
- OSD layout stays stable when switching rapidly.

### B. Mode Switch Latency

1. Switch between Session, Mixer, Instrument, Device Controller, User1/User2, Step Sequencers.
2. Observe visual update delay.

Pass criteria:
- Visual mode transition is effectively immediate and under 100 ms.

### C. Pad Color Mirroring

1. Trigger LP95 pad LED updates (clips, step sequencer states, mute/solo/arm states).
2. Confirm corresponding grid pads update color in the JWeb renderer.

Pass criteria:
- Pad changes are live and continuous.
- MK2+/X/Mini MK3 colors appear consistent with hardware intent.

### D. Legacy OSD + New Grid Coexistence

1. Run original `Launchpad95OSDHelper.amxd`.
2. Run `Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd` at the same time.
3. Use normal workflow and switch modes repeatedly.

Pass criteria:
- No crashes, no listener storms, no stuck UI state.

### E. Graceful Degradation

1. Load the grid device while Launchpad2000 control surface is not active.
2. Check bridge behavior.

Pass criteria:
- Device does not hard-fail.
- Status output indicates waiting/retry behavior rather than throwing.

### F. Frozen Device Check

1. Freeze/device-package `Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd` in Max.
2. Reopen in Live.

Pass criteria:
- `launchpad_grid.html` loads.
- Bridge can still route mode and pad updates.

## 4) Regression Checks for LP95 Behavior

These checks ensure additive changes did not alter upstream behavior.

1. Session launch behavior unchanged.
2. Mixer controls unchanged.
3. Instrument quick-scale and scale overlays unchanged.
4. Device Controller behavior unchanged.
5. Step Sequencer workflows unchanged.

Pass criteria:
- No control-surface behavior regression relative to baseline LP95.

## 5) Troubleshooting Checklist

1. If OSD does not update, confirm `Launchpad2000` is the selected control surface in Live.
2. If grid renders but colors do not change, verify `pad_colors` updates are flowing from Python to M4LInterface.
3. If no template loads, verify `osd_maps/generated_templates/manifest.json` path and mode routes.
4. If JWeb is blank, verify `launchpad_grid.html` path and that `window.max.outlet('ready')` is firing.
5. If mode routing is wrong, verify `mode_id` values in Python mode setters and route keys in manifest.

## 6) Manual Sign-off Record

Use this mini checklist while validating in Live:

- [ ] `Launchpad2000` appears in Ableton control surface list
- [ ] LP95 baseline behavior preserved
- [ ] `Launchpad2000_Grid.amxd` built and wired
- [ ] 17 templates render correctly
- [ ] mode switch latency < 100 ms
- [ ] pad colors mirror LED state
- [ ] coexistence with legacy OSD verified
- [ ] frozen device loads HTML and routes updates
